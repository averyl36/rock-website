Our 'Pet Rock Sitting' website for CS 515: Human-Centered Computing!!

## Assignment Description
Practice intentional website design by creating a website with your group that contains the following components. Remember that our theme this year is "Pet Rock Sitting Service" :). Your website must follow the theme. When you are finished, you will turn in a report that links to your group's site. Only one submission per group is required.

### Requirements
Your report must include a link to your new website which consists of:
- A home page
- A blog section with at least three articles related to your company (you can have an AI write the articles)
- A pricing page showing at least 3 services or subscription levels your company offers and their prices
- A payment page or pop-up (Don't accept real credit card numbers!)
- An "about" page with (fictional) details  
- A "careers" page with at least three job postings (you can have AI write the job postings)
- A "contact" page with a working way to send messages to your group via email, ticketing system, chat app, ect. Be ready for spam to come through this! Don't use your personal email!

- These pages must all be strongly connected components, meaning you can eventually reach any page from any other page on the site using links. 
- Your website must be reachable using the HTTPS protocol with a valid TLS certificate
- Your domain name must use the ".com" TLD (for fairness in the SEO competition later)
- Your report must include the names of everyone in your group
- Your report must be written in English, with minimal distracting errors
- Your report must describe your design choices including:
- At least 5 real websites you found useful as examples, and what you chose to do similarly for each one
- What color palette you chose, and why those colors work well in this design
- What fonts and sizes you chose, and why those work well in this design
- What layout you used, and why this works well in your design

Extra Grad Requirement:
- Describe how your design works on both desktop and mobile screens 
- What changes do you make to the layout to make your site easy to use on small touch screens?
- This will be scored as part of the "layout" requirement in the rubric
  
### Getting started
For purchasing a domain, choose a company who you trust to charge the correct amount to your credit card. Some companies charge fees on top of required registration fees to work with them. Cloudflare does not. You can also buy domain names from GoDaddy, AWS, Squarespace, and others.

For hosting your website, I suggest using a hosting service so you don't have to worry about maintaining the server. This can be done with Cloudflare pages, GitHub pages, or any other service you prefer. If you choose to pay for a service like Squarespace to host your website, be aware that adding analytics and other tools we will use later on may be behind a paywall.

### Check your work
The rubric we will use to grade this project is available. We like to be transparent, and you will have a good idea of what score you will receive before you ever submit. Remember to set internal group deadlines ahead of the full deadline and hold each other accountable for what each person promised.

### How to submit
Submit a single report for your group in PDF format.
